	 * The callback function is called for all events originating from this 
	 * device manager's devices that satisfy the callif condition.
	 * 
	 * If the listener was already added, even with a different callif,
	 * the function has no effect and `false` is returned.
	 *
	 * The device manager keeps a weak reference (std::weak_ptr) to the listener.

	 *
	 * A null callback condition `refCallIf` means that the callback function is
	 * called for all events. The device manager keeps a strong reference to the
	 * callif object as long as the listener remains in the device manager.
	 *
	 * The event parameter passed to the callback function can be queued
	 * (outlive the callback) or modified if its interface allows it.
