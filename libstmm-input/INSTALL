# libstmm-input
#===============

Requirements
------------
g++ compiler or compatible (>= C++14)


Instructions
------------

From this directory execute the following commands:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

  $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Instead of 'Release' CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can also be set to
   'Debug', 'MinSizeRel' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.
To build the documentation add option (before '..')
   '-D BUILD_DOCS=ON' to the preceding command.
To execute the tests add option'-D BUILD_TESTING=ON' to the preceding command
   (read below how to setup google test).
To change the installation directory add definition
   '-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/adam/mylib' to the preceding command.

  $ make

  $ sudo make install

sudo might be omitted if installing to a directory owned by the current user.

  $ sudo ldconfig


Alternatively you can just execute the script

  $ ./install_libstmm-input.sh  Release  /home/adam/mylib

setting the parameters to your preferred value (like above).


Setting up googletest
---------------------

If your Linux distribution already provides a googletest package and both
the include and binary files are installed in the usual paths (either
'/usr/include', '/usr/lib', '/usr/local/include', etc.), the tests should 
compile and run provided the version is 1.7 or above.

If it's not the case download googletest from github.com and compile it.
Make sure library objects ('libgtest.so' and 'libgtest_main.so') are generated
by setting BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option to ON.
Back within the libstmm-input project use cmake-gui to set the 
BUILD_TESTING_GOOGLE_TEST_LIBRARY_PATH cache variable to the directory where
'libgtest.so' and 'libgtest_main.so' are located. Also set the
BUILD_TESTING_GOOGLE_TEST_INCLUDE_PATH cache variable to the 'include' 
directory that contains the 'gtest/' folder in which 'gtest.h' is located.

As described above set BUILD_TESTING=ON to execute the tests.
