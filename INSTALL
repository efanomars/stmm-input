Installation
============

Each project is separate and has its own description (README.md),
license, installing instructions, etc. and can be handled in its 
own subfolder.
But since the projects partially depend on each other, a script is
provided to compile and install the binaries in the right order.

  install_stmm-input-all.sh  Debug  /usr/local

Compiles (debug mode) and installs all libraries and the executable
to the directory (prefix) '/usr/local'.
The first parameter can also be 'Release', 'MinSizeRel' or 'RelWithDebInfo'
(see cmake documentation).
The second parameter can be omitted (usually '/usr/local' is the default).
