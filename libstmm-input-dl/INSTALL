#==================
# libstmm-input-dl
#==================

Requirements
------------
g++ compiler or compatible (>= C++14)
libstmm-input-base
libdl for dynamically loading shared libraries


Important note
--------------
This library should be installed in a standard location like /usr/local
so that plug-in libraries installed in the same path will be found by
the loader.
Example: if this library is installed to /usr/local, a plug-in foo should too.
This way its plug-in file 90foo.dlp (see documentation) is installed into folder
/usr/local/etc/stmm-input-dl where it is found by libstmm-input-dl.


Instructions
------------

From this directory execute the following commands:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

  $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Instead of 'Release' CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can also be set to
   'Debug', 'MinSizeRel' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.
To build the documentation add option (before '..')
   '-D BUILD_DOCS=ON' to the preceding command.
To build the tests add option
   '-D BUILD_TESTING=ON' to the preceding command
To change the default installation directory add definition
   '-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/adam/mylib' to the preceding command.

  $ make

  $ sudo make install

sudo might be omitted in the preceding command if installing to a directory 
owned by the current user.

  $ sudo ldconfig


Alternatively you can just execute the script

  $ ./scripts/install_libstmm-input-dl.py -b=Release -t=On -d=On

setting the parameter(s) to your preferred value (like above).

  $ ./scripts/install_libstmm-input-dl.py  --help

for a description of all available options.
