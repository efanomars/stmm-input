/** Dynamic plug-in loader device manager class.
 * The contained device managers (the children) must be subclasses of ChildDeviceManager.
 * A child device manager must be defined within its own shared library, compiled with
 * the "-Wl,-E" flag (g++ only!) that implements the (extern "C") interface defined in
 * <stmm-input-dl/plugininterface.h>:
 *
 *     shared_ptr<ChildDeviceManager> createPlugin(const std::string sAppName, bool bEnableEventClasses
 *                                   , const std::vector<Event::Class>& aEnDisableEventClasses);
 *
 * The plugins (.dlp) are found by an instance of this class by searching the plugin paths.
 * The first to be searched is the optional one passed to the create() function.
 * The second is the local user path (ex. ~/.local/share/stmm-input-dl) and
 * the third is the system path (ex. /usr/local/share/stmm-input-dl).
 *
 * A plugin file (ex. myplugin.dlp) has the following format:
 *
 *     # Lines that start with #=#+#=# separate blocks.
 *     # Other lines that start with # are comments. Comments are ignored.
 *     # The first block of (non comment) lines are the library paths. These strings
 *     # are passed to the dlopen() function. If one succeeds to load the plugin,
 *     # an instance is created by calling the createPlugin function (see above).
 *     libmyplugin.so
 *     libmyplugin.so.0
 *     /usr/local/lib/libmyplugin.so
 *     /usr/local/lib/libmyplugin.so.0
 *     #=#+#=# This line marks the next block ...
 *     # ... which contains the plugins names that the to be loaded plugin depends on.
 *     # This causes them to be loaded with dlopen before this one.
 *     # This names must be present as .dlp files on any of the plugin paths,
 *     # otherwise they are ignored. The loading of myplugin.dlp library is still
 *     # attempted anyway. Note that the dependency doesn't include the ".dlp".
 *     my-other-plugin
 *     #=#+#=# The next block is a description of the plugin.
 *     myplugin creates devices that do this and that.
 *
 * Plugins can be disabled without removing their .dlp file. In each plugin path
 * the optional file "disabled-dlps.txt" defines the disabled plugin names.
 * The plugin names (without the .dlp extension) are listed one per line.
 * Example: if you want to disable the above plugin
 *
 *     # Comments are ignored here too.
 *     # This is "disabled-dlps.txt" in directory ~/.local/share/stmm-input-dl
 *     myplugin
 *     # If a plugin name doesn't exist as .dlp file, it is just skipped.
 *     some-other-plugin
