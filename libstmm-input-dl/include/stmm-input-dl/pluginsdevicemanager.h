/** Dynamic plug-in loader device manager class.
 * The contained device managers (the children) must be subclasses of ChildDeviceManager.
 * A child device manager must be defined within its own shared library, compiled with
 * the "-Wl,-E" flag (g++ only!) that implements the (extern "C") interface defined in
 * <stmm-input-dl/plugininterface.h>:
 *
 *     shared_ptr<ChildDeviceManager> createPlugin(const std::string sAppName, bool bEnableEventClasses
 *                                   , const std::vector<Event::Class>& aEnDisableEventClasses);
 *
 * The plugins (.dlp) are found by an instance of this class by searching the plugin paths.
 * The first to be searched is the optional one passed to the create() function.
 * The second is the local system path (ex. /usr/local/etc/stmm-input-dl).
 * The third (if library installed in /usr/lib)) is the system path (ex. /etc/stmm-input-dl).
 *
 * A plugin file name (ex. 90myplugin.dlp) is composed by the rank within the path
 * (the first two digits, here 90), the suffix (.dlp) and the plugin name (myplugin).
 * If two or more files define the same plugin name only the one with smallest
 * rank number is loaded (70foo.dlp has higher rank than 90foo.dlp).
 *
 * The content of a plugin file has the following format:
 *
 *     # Lines that start with #=#+#=# separate blocks.
 *     # Other lines that start with # are comments. Comments are ignored.
 *     # The first block of (non comment) lines are the library paths. These strings
 *     # are passed to the dlopen() function. If one succeeds to load the plugin,
 *     # an instance is created by calling the createPlugin function (see above).
 *     libmyplugin.so.0
 *     libmyplugin.so
 *     /usr/local/lib/libmyplugin.so.0
 *     /usr/lib/libmyplugin.so.0
 *     #=#+#=# This line marks the next block ...
 *     # ... which contains the plugins names that the to be loaded plugin depends on.
 *     # This causes them to be loaded with dlopen before this one.
 *     # These names must be present as .dlp files on any of the plugin paths,
 *     # otherwise they are ignored. The loading of myplugin.dlp library is still
 *     # attempted anyway. Note that the dependency doesn't include the ".dlp".
 *     my-other-plugin
 *     #=#+#=# The next block is a description of the plugin.
 *     myplugin creates devices that do this and that.
 *     #=#+#=# The next block contains a list of groups the plugin belongs to.
 *     # Groups can be used by PluginsDeviceManager to selectively load only
 *     # a subset of the enabled plugins. Each line contains a group name.
 *     # A group name is made of following characters (regex notation):
 *     #     [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*
 *     gtk
 *
 * Plugins can be disabled without removing their .dlp file. In each plugin path
 * and additionally in the local user path (ex. ~/.local/etc/stmm-input-dl)
 * the optional file "disabled-dlps.txt" defines the disabled plugin names.
 * The plugin names (without the .dlp extension) are listed one per line.
 * Example: if you want to disable the above plugin
 *
 *     # Comments are ignored here too.
 *     # This is "disabled-dlps.txt" in directory ~/.local/share/stmm-input-dl
 *     myplugin
 *     # If a plugin name doesn't exist as .dlp file, it is just skipped.
 *     some-other-plugin

	 * If m_bEnableEventClasses is `true` then all event classes in m_aEnDisableEventClasses are enabled, all others disabled,
	 * if `false` then all event classes supported by this instance are enabled except those in m_aEnDisableEventClasses.
	 *
	 * Example: To enable just events of type KeyEvent and PointerEvent set parameters
	 *
	 *     m_bEnableEventClasses = true,  m_aEnDisableEventClasses = {stmi::KeyEvent::getClass(), stmi::PointerEvent::getClass()}
	 *
	 * The m_bEnableEventClasses and m_aEnDisableEventClasses parameters to this function are
	 * also passed to the plug-in device managers, which are stored as children of this class.
	 * The application name (m_sAppName) is passed to the child plug ins.
	 *
	 * If m_bEnablePlugins is `true` then all plugin names in m_aEnDisablePlugins are enabled, all others disabled,
	 * if `false` then all plugin names found by this instance are enabled except those in m_aEnDisablePlugins.
	 *
	 * Example: to enable all plugins (to be understood as "don't disable any plugin name")
	 *
	 *     m_bEnablePlugins = false,  m_aEnDisablePlugins = {}   (which is the default)
	 *
	 * The plug-in names in m_aEnDisablePlugins don't include the first two digits and the".dlp" extension
	 * of the corresponding plug-in file.

	 * If m_aGroups is empty, the plugin's groups are ignored (all are loaded).
	 * Otherwise, in order to be loaded, the plugin either must have no group declared or
	 * at least one of its groups must be in m_aGroups.
