/** Device manager that attaches to Gtk's main event loop.
 * The created device manager needs stmi::GtkAccessor-wrapped Gtk::Window
 * references in order to receive events, which are only sent to the currently
 * active window (provided it was added with DeviceManager::addAccessor()).
 *
 * Currently the following devices are supported:
 *    - master keyboard, pointer and touch.
 *    - joysticks mapped to files "/dev/input/jsN".
 *    - any device loaded by the plugin device manager.
 *
 * The supported events types are:
 *    - stmi::KeyEvent
 *    - stmi::PointerEvent and stmi::PointerScrollEvent
 *    - stmi::TouchEvent
 *    - stmi::JoystickHatEvent, stmi::JoystickButtonEvent and JoystickAxisEvent
 *    - stmi::DeviceMgmtEvent
 *
 * When there is a change of active window, all the keys, buttons, touches
 * are canceled. 
 * Example: for each pressed keys a KeyEvent of type KeyEvent::KEY_RELEASE_CANCEL
 * is sent to the listeners.
