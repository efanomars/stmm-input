/** Class for testing code that interacts with device managers.
 * It allows to add and remove listeners, create and remove devices (which trigger
 * a DeviceMgmtEvent to be sent to listeners), send events to the listeners but
 * without providing a consistent state of the fake devices. This means that
 * when a device or a listener is removed pressed keys aren't canceled and that
 * the user has to make sure for example that the press of a key isn't followed
 * by another press of the same key but rather by a release or a cancel.
 * This also means that the JoystickCapability's methods shouldn't be called by 
 * the to be tested code because they return bogus values.
 *
 * This class is supposed to be instantiated with std::make_shared().
