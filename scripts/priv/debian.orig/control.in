Description: Device input event library - gtk manager
 Extensible device input event library for C++ (C++14).
 .
 This library provides a Gtk device manager that sends events defined in the
 libstmm-input-ev@STMM_INPUT_EV_MAJOR_VERSION@ library.
 .
 The events are generated for the following devices:
   - master keyboard and pointer
   - joysticks (use jstest-gtk to calibrate them)
   - any device supported by plugin device managers
 .
 The device manager attaches itself to the Gtk event loop, so that its
 events can easily be processed within a gtkmm application, while allowing
 gtk's normal events to be received too.
