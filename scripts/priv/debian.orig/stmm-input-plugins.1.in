.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Command line utility that manages the plugin device managers loaded by 
the libstmm-input-dl library (stmm-input).

.PP
To disable a plugin it adds a line containing the plugin name in the
file "@STMMI_PLUGINS_USER_DATA_DIR@/disabled-dlps.txt".
.br
To enable a plugin it comments out all the lines containing the plugin
name in '@STMMI_PLUGINS_USER_DATA_DIR@/disabled-dlps.txt' and
"@STMMI_PLUGINS_DATA_DIR1@/disabled-dlps.txt" if the command is called
with sudo.

.PP
The plugin can be identified by the ending of its name, provided it is
unique among the available plugins and it is at least two letters long.

Example: command

    $ stmm-input-plugins -d stmm-input-xi

can be abbreviated as

    $ stmm-input-plugins -d xi

provided no other plugin ends with \fBxi\fR.
